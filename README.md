## Key Topics Covered
Loading CSV Files: Step-by-step guide to import Comma-Separated Values (CSV) files into Power BI. <br>
Connecting to Databases: A walkthrough of connecting to databases and retrieving data.


## Analysis
The analysis focuses on breaking down the complex process of loading files into Power BI into easy-to-follow steps. We examine specific file formats, demonstrate actions within Power BI, and examine best practices for data transformation. By adopting a hands-on approach, users can seamlessly import their data into Power BI and derive meaningful insights. <br>
The following steps are used to load files into the Power BI Desktop. Note, that we can import various types of data files into Power BI.  We are just going to use a .csv file first. <br>

 1. Open your Microsoft Power BI Desktop.
